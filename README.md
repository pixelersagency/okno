# Okno

**Visual editing for headless WordPress.** Your editors see the real front end — Next.js, Astro, Remix, Vite, Nuxt, SvelteKit or plain HTML — inside wp-admin. They click a heading, change it, watch it update live, save, and publish. Your existing ACF fields stay the single source of truth: no new content model, no page builder, no lock-in.

> *Okno* means *window* in Polish, Czech and Russian — a window onto the real site.

> **Status: 1.0 beta.** The interface is in English and French (it follows the WordPress site language).

## Why

Headless WordPress gives developers a modern front end, but it takes the "what you see" away from editors. They fill in forms blind, wait for a build, and discover the result on the live site. Okno puts the site back in front of them, without asking developers to give up their stack.

- **Works with any front end.** A ~10 KB, dependency-free bridge talks to wp-admin through `postMessage`. React apps get a one-line component.
- **Your data model, untouched.** Okno reads and writes the ACF fields you already have — repeaters, groups, flexible content, relationships, images.
- **Nothing public.** The bridge never calls the WordPress API and holds no secrets. Every message is origin-checked on both sides.
- **Publishing that fits your hosting.** Live content, a build hook (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages), GitHub Actions with live build status, a publish commit, or Coolify.

## How it works

                     WordPress + ACF
```

1. The editor loads your front end in an iframe.
2. The bridge finds the elements you annotated with `data-wp-field` and reports them.
3. Clicking an element opens its field. Typing updates the page instantly, in the browser only.
4. **Save** writes to WordPress. **Publish** triggers your deployment (or nothing at all in live mode).

## Quick start

### 1. Install the plugin

[Download `okno.zip`](https://github.com/pixelersagency/okno/releases/latest/download/okno.zip) (latest version, also listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/pixelersagency/okno/releases)) and upload it in **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**. Requires WordPress 6.0+, PHP 7.4+ and [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) (free or Pro). Without ACF, only the title and featured image are editable.

### 2. Point it at your site

**Okno → Settings**: your front-end URL, the post types editors may open, and the URL pattern for each one (`/{slug}` by default; the front page maps to `/`).

### 3. Allow wp-admin to frame your site

Send this header from your front end (**Okno → Get started** shows it with your domain filled in, and checks it for you):

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://your-wordpress.example
```

### 4. Add the bridge and annotate your markup

**React (Next.js, Remix, Vite…)**

```bash
npm install @pixelersagency/okno-bridge
```

```jsx
// Root layout: app/layout.tsx, root.tsx, App.tsx…
import { OknoBridge } from '@pixelersagency/okno-bridge/react';

<OknoBridge wpOrigin="https://your-wordpress.example" />
```

**Any other site (Astro, Nuxt, SvelteKit, HTML)**: copy `okno-bridge.js` (downloadable from **Okno → Get started**) to your public folder and add to `<head>`:

```html
<script>
  // Loads the bridge only inside the editor: visitors get ~150 bytes, not 10 KB.
  if (window.self !== window.top) {
    var s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = '/okno-bridge.js';
    s.setAttribute('data-wp-origin', 'https://your-wordpress.example');
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  }
</script>
```

Then annotate what should be editable:

```html
<main data-wp-post="12">
  <h1 data-wp-field="_title">About us</h1>
  <p data-wp-field="intro">We build things.</p>
  <img data-wp-field="hero_image" src="/hero.jpg" alt="" />
</main>
```

Back in wp-admin, **Okno → Get started → Test the connection** confirms that the bridge answers. You're done. Step-by-step setups for each framework are in [`examples/`](examples/).

> **Using a coding agent?** **Okno → Get started** gives you ready-to-paste prompts and the full integration contract ([`plugin/docs/agent-instructions.md`](plugin/docs/agent-instructions.md)) for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex and the like.

## Annotations

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data-wp-post="12"` | Container: the WordPress post ID for the fields inside |
| `data-wp-field="hero_title"` | Editable element: ACF field name, or `_title` / `_thumbnail` |
| `data-wp-field="cards.0.title"` | Dotted paths reach into repeaters, flexible content and groups |
| `data-okno-apply="html"` | The value contains markup (an accent `<span>` in a heading): inject filtered HTML instead of text |
| `data-okno-refresh="save"` | No live preview for this field; reload the page after saving (complex WYSIWYG rendering) |
| `data-okno-section="Hero"` | Name a section in the Structure tree |
| `data-okno-layout="sections.2"` | Bind a section to a flexible content row, so editors can add, move, duplicate and remove it |
| `data-okno-managed="menu"` | Content managed elsewhere (menus, post lists, WooCommerce): clicking explains where to edit it |
| `data-okno-edit-url="…"` | The wp-admin screen for that managed content |

**One rule:** always render an annotated element, even when its value is empty. `{title && <h2 data-wp-field="title">…}` breaks live editing, because an element missing from the page can't be filled in. Okno flags such fields as "not on this page".

Client-side navigation (React Router, Next.js links, `history.pushState`) and re-renders are handled: the bridge re-scans the page and keeps unsaved edits applied.

## Supported fields

- **Content**: text, textarea, WYSIWYG, number, range, URL, email, oEmbed, page link, link, select, true/false, date, date-time, time.
- **Media**: image (with crop-ratio warnings), file, gallery.
- **Relations**: post object, relationship, taxonomy.
- **Containers**: repeater, group, clone, flexible content, nested freely.
- **Native**: title and featured image.

Other field types show up read-only, with a link to the classic WordPress editor.

## What editors get

- Live preview while typing, with character counters where fields have a limit.
- Undo / redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z) and Ctrl+S to save.
- Local drafts: unsaved changes survive a closed tab, and are offered back on return.
- Page composition: add, reorder, duplicate and remove flexible content blocks.
- Create, duplicate and trash pages without leaving the editor.
- Conflict protection: if someone else changed the page meanwhile, Okno refuses to overwrite it and offers to reload.
- Change history: every saved change, with its before and after values and its author.
- Deep links: "Edit with Okno" in the admin bar opens the current page.

## Publishing modes

| Mode | For | What Publish does |
|---|---|---|
| **Live content** | Sites that fetch WordPress at request time (SSR, ISR) | Nothing to publish: saving is enough, the button is hidden |
| **Build hook** | Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, any rebuild URL | POSTs to the hook |
| **GitHub Actions** | Static builds run in Actions | Dispatches a workflow and follows the run live |
| **GitHub commit** | Hosts that deploy on every push | Pushes an empty commit to the branch |
| **Coolify** | Self-hosted Coolify | Calls the deployment webhook |

Tokens are encrypted in the database with a key derived from your WordPress salts. GitHub settings are checked when saved: repository, branch, workflow and token expiry.

## Security

- No public REST endpoint. Every route checks a nonce and `edit_post` on the content. Publishing requires `publish_pages` (filter `okno_deploy_capability`), settings require `manage_options`.
- The bridge is inert outside the editor iframe and checks the origin of every message, in both directions. It makes no network request.
- Values are sanitized per field type on write. `required` and `maxlength` are enforced server side. Attachments and related posts are checked for read access.
- Use a fine-grained GitHub token limited to the deployment repository (`Actions: write`, or `Contents: write` for the commit mode).

Found a vulnerability? See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Extending

- **Other field plugins**: implement `Okno_Adapter_Interface` and register it with the `okno_adapters` filter (Meta Box, JetEngine, Pods…).
- **Other deployment targets**: implement `Okno_Deploy_Driver_Interface` and plug it in with `okno_deploy_driver`.
- **WYSIWYG preview**: `okno_wysiwyg_render` replaces `wpautop()` with your front end's actual rendering.
