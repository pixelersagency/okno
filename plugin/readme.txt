Visual editing for headless WordPress. Editors see the real front end inside wp-admin, click, edit ACF fields live, save and publish.

== Description ==

Okno loads your headless front end (Next.js, Astro, Remix, Vite, Nuxt, SvelteKit or plain HTML) inside wp-admin. Editors click an element, edit the ACF field behind it, watch the page update as they type, then save and publish.

* Works with any front end through a small, dependency-free bridge script. React apps get a one-line component.
* Uses the ACF fields you already have: text, WYSIWYG, images, galleries, links, relationships, repeaters, groups and flexible content.
* Page composition: add, reorder, duplicate and remove flexible content blocks.
* Undo and redo, local drafts, conflict protection and a full change history.
* Publishing modes: live content, build hook (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages), GitHub Actions with live status, publish commit, Coolify.
* No public endpoint and no secret on the front end.

The admin interface is currently in French.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does my site need to be built with React? =

No. The bridge is plain JavaScript and works with any HTML page. React apps can use the optional component.

= Does Okno store content somewhere else? =

No. Everything is saved to your existing ACF fields and post data.

= What happens to my data if I delete the plugin? =

Okno removes its own settings, tokens, history table and internal post meta. Your content and ACF fields are left untouched.

* New visual identity in Pixelers colours.

= 1.0.0-beta.1 =
* First public release. See CHANGELOG.md on GitHub for details.
